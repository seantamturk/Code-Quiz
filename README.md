# Professional Portfolio ReadMe

## Description 

Welcome to my coding project! In this project, I have created a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. The purpose of this project is to help me become familiar with coding assessments commonly used in job interviews. The app runs in the browser and features dynamic HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I have written. I have designed the user interface to be clean, polished, and responsive. Throughout the module, I have learned all the skills I need to succeed in this assignment. I understand that coding assessments are an important part of the interview process for developers, and this project will help me prepare for them. Employers often use coding assessments to filter out job candidates, so it's crucial to do well. The project also includes a set of technical interview questions with increasing difficulty levels, designed to help me become a more proficient developer. By taking advantage of these opportunities to practice, I'll be well-prepared to shine during the technical interview process.

Overall, this project is a valuable addition to my portfolio that sets me up for future success and provides valuable practice in my skills as a web developer.
